# First medium homework
## Assumptions
We were instructed to create a simple currency calculator using HTML, CSS and JS (using methods we have learned so far).

## My plan
- Create a calculator showing the amount of cryptocurrency (three most popular) we are able to buy with the funds we have (also depending on the currency).
- Create 'dream' table showing the amount of cryptocurrency (also three most popular) we could buy in three history dates. 
- Added to 'dream' table lost value. Value we had lost by not investing in cryptocurrencies on the set dates.
- Create a form that allows you to change the exchange values for all currencies.
- Create a menu that allows you to hide calculator and settings sections.
